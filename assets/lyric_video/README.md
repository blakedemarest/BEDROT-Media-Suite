# Lyric Video Assets

Placeholder directories for Lyric Video Uploader templates:

- `templates/` – ASS/JSON preset descriptors (pending).
- `backgrounds/` – Looping video backgrounds or stills for lyric renders.
- `fonts/` – Typeface files referenced by presets.

Populate these folders when authoring presets. The current implementation only validates their existence.
