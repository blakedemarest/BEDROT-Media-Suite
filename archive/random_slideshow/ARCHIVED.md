# Random Slideshow (Archived)

This directory preserves the legacy PyQt5 random slideshow generator as of 2025-10-28.
Do not move it back into `src/` or execute it unless the module undergoes a full
revival plan with updated configs, tests, and launcher integration.

Former root-level configuration files now live in `archive/random_slideshow/config_root/`.
