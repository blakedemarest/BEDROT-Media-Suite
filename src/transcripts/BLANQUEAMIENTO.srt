00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:32,159
my

218
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:32,680
grandmothers

219
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,019
now,

220
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:33,799
both

221
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:33,920
of

222
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:34,620
them,

223
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:34,739
the

224
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:34,920
one

225
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:35,019
who

226
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:35,519
forgot

227
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:35,780
and

228
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:35,859
the

229
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:36,079
one

230
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:36,180
who

231
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:36,819
erased,

232
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:37,439
I

233
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:37,599
would

234
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:37,780
say

235
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,980
nothing.

236
00:01:39,019 --> 00:01:39,060
I

237
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:39,200
would

238
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:39,359
just

239
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:39,599
sit

240
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,480
there,

241
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:40,700
bite

242
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:40,840
my

243
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:41,879
tongue,

244
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:42,180
wish

245
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:42,299
the

246
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:42,540
world

247
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:42,659
had

248
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:42,799
been

249
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:45,200
different.

250
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:47,480
That's

251
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:47,599
the

252
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:47,859
grief

253
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,000
you

254
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:48,920
see,

255
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:49,040
the

256
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,560
silence

257
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:49,950
underneath

258
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,219
everything,

259
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:51,359
the

260
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:51,819
silence

261
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:51,959
where

262
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,079
the

263
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:52,540
Spanish

264
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:52,739
used

265
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:52,840
to

266
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,780
be,

267
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:53,900
the

268
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:54,379
silence

269
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:54,519
where

270
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:54,620
the

271
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:55,040
story

272
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:55,219
should

273
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:55,359
have

274
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,400
lived,

275
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:56,540
the

276
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:56,980
silence

277
00:01:57,019 --> 00:01:57,099
that

278
00:01:57,219 --> 00:01:57,459
sounds

279
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:57,599
like

280
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,420
assimilation

281
00:01:58,819 --> 00:01:58,920
but

282
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,200
feels

283
00:01:59,219 --> 00:01:59,359
like

284
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:00,519
amputation.

285
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,340
Let

286
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:01,459

289
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:01,840

342
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:22,989
This

343
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:23,139
is

344
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:23,259
the

Would

355
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:27,900

00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:28,909
am

522
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,060
the

00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:29,900
story

525
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,030
of

526
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,139

528
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:30,780
I

529
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:30,979
never

530
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:32,280
chose.

531
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:32,379
And

532
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:32,500
I

533
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:32,680
don't

534
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:32,810
know

535
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:32,939
how

536
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:33,039
to

537
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:33,379
mourn

538
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:33,740
something

539
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:33,919
that

540
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,139
gave

541
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:34,340
me

542
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:34,780

545
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:39,620
So

566
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:47,259
can

567
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:47,530

life

572
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:49,490

576
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,680
everything.

577
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:54,419
For

578
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:54,580
my

581
00:03:55,939 --> 00:03:56,090
what

582
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,240
they

583
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:56,479
