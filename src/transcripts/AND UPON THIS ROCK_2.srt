1
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:10,460
You

2
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:11,099
walk

3
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:11,339
the

4
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:11,759
edge

5
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:12,300
where

6
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,259
angels

7
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:14,419
choke,

8
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:14,859
Where

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,460
every

10
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,239
halo

11
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,059
smells

12
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:17,339
of

13
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,320
smoke,

14
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:19,539
Where

15
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,039
faith

16
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:20,420
is

17
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:20,780
but

18
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:21,039
a

19
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,100
splintered

20
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:23,140
lie,

21
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:23,420
And

22
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:24,239
mercy

23
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,019
learns

24
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:25,339
to

25
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:25,899
bow

26
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:26,359
and

27
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,859
die.

28
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:28,160
We

29
00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:28,780
taste

30
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:29,099
the

31
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,160
night,

32
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:30,539
its

33
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,379
shattered

34
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,759
drops,

35
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:32,960
A

36
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:33,820
chalice

37
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,380
made

38
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:34,740
of

39
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,560
heart and

40
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:36,340
rot,

41
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:37,299
A

42
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,340
Eucharist

43
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:38,609
of

44
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:39,500
blackened

46
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,539
bone,

47
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:40,700
A

48
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:41,359
mass

49
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:41,759
for

50
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:42,380
those

51
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:42,780
who

52
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:43,359
walk

53
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:44,539
alone.

54
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:45,579
For

55
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,100
every

56
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:46,759
prayer

57
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:47,340
that

58
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:47,920
turned

59
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,380
amass,

61
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:49,619
The

62
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,520
ancient

63
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:51,060
hymn

64
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:51,439
that

65
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,240
lost

66
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:52,700
its

67
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:53,759
path,

68
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:54,740
To

69
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:55,460
wretched

70
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,219
saints

71
00:00:56,299 --> 00:00:56,579

74
00:00:58,299 --> 00:00:58,579
Who

81
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:03,579
tight.

82
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:03,859
You

00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:04,480
drink

84
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:04,700
the

85
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,480
sorrow

86
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:06,049
none

87

quell,

89
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:08,069
And

00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:08,579
wear

91
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,079
its

92
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:09,719
taste

93
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:10,159
like

94
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:11,140
private

95
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:12,099
hell.

96
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:12,420
You

97
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,159

A

105
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,260
spoken

106
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:19,120
grim

107
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:19,500
and

108
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,079
tuned.

109
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,420
We

110
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:26,159
raise

111
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:26,439

115
00:01:29,379 --> 00:01:30,939
scorched,

116
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,379
From

00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:37,359
torched.

123
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:39,819
Yes,

124
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:41,959
